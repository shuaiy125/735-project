    "## Why Documentation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is one of the most important yet often neglected aspects of software development. For scientific computing and statistical methods, good documentation serves several critical purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Reproducibility:* Well-documented code enables others to understand, verify, and reproduce your analyses. This is fundamental to scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Collaboration:* When working with others (or your future self), documentation explains not just *what* the code does, but *why* it does it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Maintainability:* Code without documentation becomes difficult to modify or debug, even shortly after writing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Adoption:* If you develop a statistical method, clear documentation dramatically increases the likelihood that others will use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about who will read your documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Future you** - In six months, you won't remember why you made certain choices\n",
    "2. **Collaborators** - Lab members, co-authors, or reviewers examining your analysis\n",
    "3. **Users** - People who want to use your functions or packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll cover the main documentation tools in Python: comments, docstrings, and type hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are explanatory text in your code that Python ignores during execution. They begin with the `#` symbol."
