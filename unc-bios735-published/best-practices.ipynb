    "# Best Coding Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code that works is only the first step. Code that is readable, maintainable, and follows established conventions will save you hours of debugging, help collaborators understand your work, and make your research more reproducible. This lecture covers the principles and practices that distinguish clean, professional code from code that merely runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Clean Code Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific computing, code is often written once and read many times. You will revisit your analysis months later, share code with collaborators, or publish it alongside a paper. Clean code reduces the cognitive load required to understand what the code does and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider who will read your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Future you** - In six months, you won't remember why you chose a particular algorithm or what that cryptic variable name means.\n",
    "2. **Collaborators** - Lab members, co-authors, or reviewers need to understand your analysis without asking you for explanations.\n",
    "3. **Users** - If you release a package, users need to understand how to use it from reading the code and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of clean code is not aesthetic perfection but practical clarity. Code should communicate intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Zen of Python\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Beautiful is better than ugly** - Write clean, visually organized code\n",
    "- **Explicit is better than implicit** - Make intentions clear; avoid hidden behavior\n",
    "- **Simple is better than complex** - Choose straightforward solutions over complicated ones\n",
    "- **Complex is better than complicated** - If complexity is needed, keep it organized rather than tangled\n",
    "- **Flat is better than nested** - Avoid deeply indented code; prefer flatter structures\n",
    "- **Sparse is better than dense** - Spread code out; don't cram too much into one line\n",
    "- **Readability counts** - Code is read more than written; prioritize clarity\n",
    "- **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules** - Maintain consistency even for edge cases\n",
    "- **Although practicality beats purity** - But be pragmatic; working code beats perfect design\n",
    "- **Errors should never pass silently** - Handle exceptions; don't ignore failures\n",
    "- **Unless explicitly silenced** - Only suppress errors when you've consciously decided to\n",
    "- **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess** - When unclear, clarify rather than assume\n",
    "- **There should be one obvious way to do it** - Aim for one clear approach to each problem\n",
    "- **Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch** - (Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, is Dutch)\n",
    "- **Now is better than never** - Don't procrastinate; write the code\n",
    "- **Although never is often better than right now** - But don't rush; plan before coding\n",
    "- **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea** - Complex explanations signal bad design\n",
    "- **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea** - Simple explanations suggest good design\n",
    "- **Namespaces are one honking great idea** - Use modules and scopes to organize code\n",
