    "## Why Debugging Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer spends significant time debugging. Studies suggest that developers spend 35-50% of their time finding and fixing bugs. For statistical computing and scientific software, debugging is particularly important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Correctness:* A subtle bug in a statistical algorithm can produce plausible but incorrect results. Unlike a crash, wrong numerical output might go unnoticed until it affects downstream analyses or publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Complexity:* Scientific code often involves intricate mathematical operations, edge cases in numerical computation, and interactions between multiple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Reproducibility:* Bugs that appear intermittently or depend on specific data characteristics are especially problematic for reproducible research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is a skill that improves with practice. Experienced programmers don't write bug-free code; they've learned systematic approaches to find and fix bugs efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the different types of bugs helps you choose appropriate debugging strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax errors** are caught by Python before your code runs. These include typos, missing colons, and unmatched parentheses."

    "Classify each of the following as a syntax error, runtime error, or logic error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A function that calculates the median but returns the mean instead.\n",

    "2. Code that tries to access `my_list[10]` when the list has only 5 elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. A function that computes correlation but returns NaN for perfectly correlated data due to floating-point issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logic error** - The code runs without exceptions but produces incorrect output. The programmer confused median with mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Runtime error** - This raises an `IndexError` when the code tries to access an index that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Syntax error** - Python's parser catches the missing colon before any code executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logic error** - The function runs and returns a value (NaN), but this isn't the correct mathematical result. It might also be considered a numerical bug, which is a specific type of logic error common in scientific computing.\n",
