    "# Version Control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a hands-on tutorial. You should follow along by running the commands on your own machine. When example files are needed, the contents are provided so you can create them yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- A terminal/command line application (Terminal on macOS/Linux, Git Bash on Windows)\n",
    "- Git installed on your machine (installation instructions below)\n",
    "- A text editor to create and modify files\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll build:** Through the exercises, you'll create a small `hello.py` file and make incremental changes to it while learning Git concepts along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Version Control Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on data analysis or developing statistical software, you've likely encountered scenarios like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You make changes to your analysis script, and suddenly nothing works. What did you change?\n",
    "- You have files named `analysis_v1.py`, `analysis_v2.py`, `analysis_final.py`, `analysis_final_FINAL.py`.\n",
    "- A collaborator emails you their version of the code, and you need to merge their changes with yours.\n",
    "- You want to try a different statistical approach but don't want to lose your current working version.\n",
    "- Months later, a reviewer asks why you used a particular method, and you can't remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems solve these problems by tracking every change made to your files, who made them, and when. They let you return to any previous state, work on experimental features without risk, and collaborate with others without chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Case for Version Control in Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "For statistical computing and scientific research, version control is particularly valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reproducibility.** Science requires that others can reproduce your results. Version control creates a complete record of how your code evolved, allowing you to reconstruct exactly what code produced a particular result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provenance.** When you return to an analysis months later, or when reviewers ask questions, you can trace back through your changes to understand why decisions were made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimentation.** Statistical analysis often involves trying different approaches. Version control lets you create separate branches to experiment with different methods without affecting your main analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration.** Research is increasingly collaborative. Version control provides structured ways to combine work from multiple people without overwriting each other's contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Before modern version control systems, people used ad-hoc methods to track changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual copies** involve creating copies of files with version numbers or dates in the filename: `analysis_v1.py`, `analysis_2024-01-15.py`. This approach quickly becomes unmanageable. Which version is actually \"final\"? What changed between versions? What if you need to combine changes from two different versions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Centralized systems** like Subversion (SVN) store all versions on a central server. Users check out files, make changes, and check them back in. This requires constant network access and creates a single point of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed systems** like Git give every user a complete copy of the entire project history. You can work offline, create branches freely, and merge changes in flexible ways. Git is now the dominant version control system, used by nearly all open source projects and most companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher has been working on an analysis project for six months. Her project folder looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis_project/\n",
    "    analysis.py\n",
    "    analysis_backup.py\n",
    "    analysis_old.py\n",
    "    analysis_new.py\n",
    "    analysis_working.py\n",
    "    analysis_FINAL.py\n",
    "    analysis_FINAL_v2.py\n",
    "    data_cleaning.py\n",
    "    data_cleaning_fixed.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify at least three problems with this approach to managing code changes, and explain how version control would address each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No clear history of changes.** It's impossible to know what changed between versions or why. With version control, each change is recorded with a message explaining what was modified and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No way to identify the current working version.** Is `analysis_FINAL_v2.py` the latest? Is `analysis_working.py` still relevant? Version control maintains a clear \"current\" state while preserving all history.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difficult to merge improvements.** If `analysis_old.py` has a useful function that was accidentally removed in later versions, recovering it requires manually comparing files. Version control can show exactly what changed and makes it easy to recover any previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No record of who made changes or when.** In collaborative work, this information is essential. Version control automatically records the author and timestamp of every change.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Wasted disk space.** Multiple near-identical copies waste storage. Version control stores only the differences between versions, efficiently handling even large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is the most widely used version control system. It's free, open source, and runs on all major operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. On most systems, you can check if Git is installed by opening a terminal and typing:"

    "### The Three States\n",
    "\n",
    "Files in a Git repository can be in three states:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Working directory:** Your project files as they currently exist on disk. This is where you edit files normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Staging area (index):** A holding area for changes you want to include in your next commit. You explicitly add changes here before committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repository:** The committed history. When you commit, Git takes everything in the staging area and permanently stores it as a new version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This three-stage design is intentional. It lets you carefully control what goes into each commit, even if you've made many changes across multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Status\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git status` command shows the current state of your repository.\n",

    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "You cloned a repository yesterday and have been working locally. Your colleague tells you she pushed important bug fixes this morning. You also have uncommitted changes. What's the safest sequence of actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `git push` to send your changes first\n",
    "2. Run `git pull` to get her changes\n",
    "3. Run `git stash` to save your changes, then `git pull`, then `git stash pop`\n",
    "4. Run `git fetch` to see what changed, then decide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 4** is the safest approach. `git fetch` downloads the remote changes without modifying your working directory, letting you review what changed before integrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "After fetching, you can:\n",
    "- See the incoming commits: `git log origin/master --oneline`\n",
    "- See what files changed: `git diff master origin/master --stat`\n",
    "- Decide how to proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3** is also reasonable if you're confident you want the remote changes. `git stash` temporarily saves your uncommitted work, lets you pull, then `git stash pop` restores your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1** would fail because the remote has new commits you don't have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2** might work, but if you have uncommitted changes that conflict with the incoming changes, it could create a messy situation.\n",
