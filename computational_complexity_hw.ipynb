Since this is done m times (once for each column of B), the overall time complexity is $O(m \\cdot n^3)$.

For example, `solve_systems_cholesky(np.array([[2, 1], [1, 2]]), np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]]))` should return `np.array([[2/3, -1/3], [-1/3, 2/3]])` (the inverse of A, since B is the identity)."

This is a significant improvement over the naive approach, especially when m is large, since the expensive factorization step is done only once."
